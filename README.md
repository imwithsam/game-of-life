# Conway's Game of Life

This is my first ever attempt at TDDing Conway's Game of Life. I have never
tried creating it before.

For this exercise, I looked only at the [intro and rules sections on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and watched
[an interview with John Conway
himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8kUJL04ELA) describing the game.

On this initial attempt, I am using RSpec and Ruby.

## To Do

- [ ] create back-end implementation
  - [ ] complete the initial implementation with RSpec and Ruby
  - [ ] refactor the initial implementation
  - [ ] TDD the game in JavaScript
  - [ ] TDD the game in Elixir
- [ ] create front-end implementation
  - [ ] create front-end implementation using the [Shoes
    gem ](https://github.com/shoes/shoes4)
  - [ ] create front-end implementation using HTML5 Canvas
  - [ ] create front-end implementation using React
  - [ ] create front-end implementation using Elm
